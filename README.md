# AoA-Complete-Armory


## Installation : 
just unzip the file's whole content in a folder.

## Use : 

First use will try to load data but it will fail since it doesn't know were to fetch them, click on "Settings" (upper right corner) and then on the "Find folder" button and select your game folder (most likely something like : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Act of Aggression Beta), then close the flyout and wait until the program finished loading everything.
**[Be sure to have .Net 4.5.1 (at least) installed](http://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=40779)**

## Known issues:
* Random crash and reboot on first use.
* Missing stats.
* Missing upgrades.
* A few deprecated/useless units and buildings.
* No Valkyrie, dunno the exact reason, might be because there is no data about it in the beta file, only its icon.

## Incoming features:
* Weapon damage ouput visualization ( the useless "Visualize"button on a weapon sheet)
* Version selection (for now, you can only load the most recent version)
